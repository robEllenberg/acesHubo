 Getting HELP
##############

Use: 
$ man cmake

or after generating the Makefiles:
$ make help

The generated Makefiles are documented as well.

 VERBOSE OUTPUT
################

In order to 'see' what 'make' is doing, use:
$ make VERBOSE=1

This can be issued from the top level or every subdirectory.

 .cmake FILES
##############
The config/ directory has 'setup' files and 'Find' files.

The setup files make sure the global build environment is
correctly detected and setup.

* check_depend.cmake:
 Find installed libraries

* global_setup.cmake:
 Ugly catch-all cmake file, avoid/remove if possible

* component_rules.cmake:
 Orocos specific macros in order to register your 
 Components to the build system. (see below)

The Find* files are called from check_depend.cmake in
order to find libraries for which no standard cmake files
are available. Mainly to detect our own libraries, such as
rtt, kdl and bfl.

 MACROS
########

The macros in the component subdirs are used from

config/component_rules.cmake:

#
# Components should add themselves by calling 'GLOBAL_ADD_COMPONENT' 
# instead of 'ADD_LIBRARY' in CMakeLists.txt.
#
# This gives a centralised location where all components are registered
# and lets us add various things to all components in just one place.
#
#
# Usage: GLOBAL_ADD_COMPONENT( COMPONENT_NAME src1 src2 src3 )
#
MACRO( GLOBAL_ADD_COMPONENT COMPONENT_NAME )

#
# Components should add tests by calling 'GLOBAL_ADD_TEST' 
# instead of 'ADD_EXECUTABLE' in CMakeLists.txt.
#
# This gives a centralised location where all tests are registered
# and lets us add various things to all components in just one place.
#
#
# Usage: GLOBAL_ADD_TEST( TEST_NAME src1 src2 src3 )
#
MACRO( GLOBAL_ADD_TEST TEST_NAME )

#
# Components supply header files which should be included when 
# using these components. Each component should use this macro
# to supply its header-files.
#
# Usage: GLOBAL_ADD_INCLUDE( RELATIVE_LOCATION hpp1, hpp2 ...)
MACRO( GLOBAL_ADD_INCLUDE COMPONENT_LOCATION )

# Link a component library with an external library (qt3, gl, readline,....)
# Usage: COMPONENT_ADD_LIBS( orocos-taskbrowser readline ncurses )
MACRO( COMPONENT_ADD_LIBS COMPONENT_NAME  )

# Link a component library with another component library
# Usage: COMPONENT_ADD_DEPS( orocos-taskbrowser orocos-reporting )
MACRO( COMPONENT_ADD_DEPS COMPONENT_NAME )

# Link a program with a component library
# Usage: PROGRAM_ADD_DEPS( taskbrowser-test orocos-reporting )
MACRO( PROGRAM_ADD_DEPS PROGRAM_NAME )

In addition, you can use the traditional CMake commmands, knowing that
COMPONENT_NAME is a library with -${OROCOS_TARGET} as suffix and
TEST_NAME is an executable. Set your editor's mode to 'shell-script'
highlighting for better syntax highlighting.

To add a component's directory to the build system, see the bottom of
the top-level CMakeLists.txt for adding it with ADD_SUBDIRECTORY and
LINK_DIRECTORIES.
